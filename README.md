Committed to protecting the planet
  </strong></h1>
  

The work to reduce greenhouse emissions has been going on for years, from household recycling programs to industry-wide regulations. Well-meaning individuals build houses and purchase cars with a smaller carbon footprint in mind. Protesters fight for policies that roll back the effects of climate change. Carbon credit programs incentivize corporations who reduce their greenhouse emissions. And while these small, individual steps have made a difference, it’s time for a comprehensive, modernized approach to protecting the planet.

Carbon credit programs incentivize corporations who reduce their greenhouse emissions. And while these small, individual steps have made a difference, it’s time for a comprehensive, modernized approach to protecting the planet. It’s time for industry and individuals to be on the same page, making the same efforts in the same direction.

If we ever want to reach the global goal of 350 parts per million for carbon emissions, we will need strategies that are accessible and affordable to all to cross the finish line.

Verde350 will be launching a decentralized blockchain-based carbon credit program to create standardization, transparency and a pricing structure for the voluntary carbon offset market. Currently, the price of carbon offsets varies widely, from less than $1 per ton to more than $50 per ton. Verde350 will establish a standardized price by tokenizing carbon credits into fungible assets. Price adjustments will be based on direct monitoring of carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, rather than on the current supply-and-demand pricing model. This will incentivize the work being done by offset removal companies that focus on tree forestation projects, carbon sequestration, and emission reduction programs.

What does a voluntary carbon credit program look like for the average person trying to reduce their footprint?

We are developing a platform that will allow people to purchase public transportation tickets, or pay for recharging their electric car, and then earn rewards. 
We will also collaborate with existing renewable energy providers, including wind, solar, bio energy and reforestation programs. 

Eventually, Verde350 seeks to also convert the mandatory carbon credit landscape and adopt our decentralized blockchain system.

<strong>
Why is Verde350 a lucrative investment?
</strong><br>
We are innovators. Our goals are community-driven. We seek sustainability, not only for our planet, but for the efforts that will successfully roll back carbon emissions.

Because the emissions market is fast-growing and becoming one of the most important environmental commodities it is a promising short-term investment.

For long-term investors, we know that the last push to the goal of 350 ppm will be the hardest and most expensive due to increasing carbon taxation. Therefore long-term holding of carbon offsets in your portfolio is a beneficial investment. We’re in it for the long haul. We’re committed to the future. And we need partners who share these goals for our planet.
